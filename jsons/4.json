    "description": "Snake Island (also called Zmiinyi Island) is where 13 Ukrainian heroes have stood tall since the first days of the Russian invasion. \"Russian warship, go f*ck yourself!\" were the last words of border guards when the occupants approached the island and proposed surrender to Ukrainians. Now, the phrase has become world-famous as a symbol of the war of good against the empire of evil. We are sure that the Russian warship regrets that it didn't agree to go f*ck itself at the time.",
