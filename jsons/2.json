    "description": "\"Palianytsia\" is a Ukrainian word that means a type of traditional local bread. It is almost impossible for Russian invaders to pronounce it correctly. As a result, \"palianytsia\" has become a phenomenon, a kind of code word that everyone knows but only Ukrainians can pronounce. This way, our people can easily recognize the enemies among us.
