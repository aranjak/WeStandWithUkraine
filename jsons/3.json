    "description": "The city of Konotop turned out to be one of the hot spots in Ukraine. Unarmed Ukrainians tried to defend Konotop as a human shield when Russian soldiers entered it. Even more, the people decided to demoralize the enemies. \"Do you know where you are? It’s Konotop. Every second woman here is a witch. Starting from tomorrow, you’ll never get hard again, ever,\" Ukrainians warned. The so-called witch superpowers refer to the events described in \"The Witch of Konotop,\" a satirical fiction story written in 1833 by Ukrainian Hryhorii Kvitka-Osnovianenko.",
