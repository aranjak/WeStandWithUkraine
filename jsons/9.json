    "description": "The Ghost of Kyiv is an urban legend about a Ukrainian military man who shot down six Russian aircraft in the first 30 hours of the Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. Pilot ace MiG-29 is also called the guardian angel of Kyiv. Since that day, he has already shot down several dozen enemy aircraft. The pilot's identity is a secret since the superhero never shows their face. And while it is possible that The Ghost of Kyiv is a collective image of several pilots, we still believe that he's a Ukrainian legend we all look up to.",
